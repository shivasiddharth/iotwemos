<p>When you are trading Cryptos it is always itching to constantly look at the prevailing rate. I wanted a gadget that could display the live Crypto rate without constantly refreshing the browser.</p><p>I have incorporated a slideshow effect for better appeal. The first slide will be an image of the Crypto logo, the second slide will be the live Crypto trading rate and the last slide will be the rate of change, that is it shows whether the price of Crypto has decreased or increased and by how much.</p><p>My first thought was to 3D print a case for this project and then when I saw a plastic box on my table, decided to recycle the old plastic instead of adding to the global plastic woes by 3D printing a new one.</p><p>I have got all the files in the git project page. You can get access to all the related files by clicking <a href="https://github.com/shivasiddharth/iotwemos/tree/master/Crypto_Ticker" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
